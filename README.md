# HazardHub
Project Overview

HAZARDHUB is a web-based safety monitoring and reporting system designed to improve workplace safety through efficient incident documentation and analysis. The system allows employees to submit hazard reports online, while administrators can monitor incidents and manage responses in real time. It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to analyze hazard descriptions and classify incidents based on risk level, helping prioritize critical cases. The system is developed using React for the frontend, Python with Flask for the backend, and MySQL for data storage, providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for safety management.

# Objectives

To replace manual and paper-based workplace safety reporting procedures

To provide a faster and more efficient method for reporting hazards and incidents
