# HazardHub
Project Overview

HazardHub is a web-based safety monitoring and incident reporting system developed for industrial workplace environments. The system is designed to replace traditional paper-based safety reporting processes by providing a centralized digital platform for reporting, monitoring, and managing workplace hazards and incidents. It enables employees to submit safety reports efficiently while allowing administrators and Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) personnel to review, track, and respond to reported issues in a timely manner. The system integrates the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm for image-based hazard and personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance detection and supports QR code access to streamline the reporting process.

# Objectives
